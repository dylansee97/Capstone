But unbeknownst to his friends and family, Chia secretly led a double life as a high-rolling hustler, complete with flashy cars, luxury apartments and a girlfriend half his age.\\n\\nHe was the darling of offshore casinos — gambling operators would personally fly him in on private jets so he could have a flutter in their betting halls.\\n\\nTo feed and fund his gambling addiction, he swindled four foreign banks out of $117 million from 1999 to 2003, using his position as the financial manager of Asia Pacific Breweries (APB). The case at that time was Singapore’s biggest involving commercial fraud.\\n\\nIn 2004, the then 44-year-old was sentenced to 42 years in jail by High Court Judge Tay Yong Kwang — the longest for a case of commercial fraud.\\n\\n“Bankers knocking on his door were there to meet the man… to forge a business relationship, but the man they met was unfortunately in the business of forgery,” said Judge Tay at the sentencing.\\n\\nChia had been a compulsive gambler since at least 1994, when he was a financial controller with Swire Pacific Offshore, a marine services company.\\n\\nHe had plunged deep into debt during 1995 to 1996 and owed several banks about $100,000 in the form of overdrafts and credit card dues. But fortune smiled on him the next year when he began visiting Star Cruise ships almost every fortnight, to try his luck at the gambling tables.\\n\\nHe won on several occasions and was offered a credit line of $75,000. In less than a year, his winnings grew to about $1 million.\\n\\nHowever, the tides turned in August 1998. In a gambling spree that lasted a fortnight, he not only lost all his previous winnings, but racked up new debts as well.\\n\\nBy the time he joined APB in 1999, the debts had mounted sky-high, and he was a desperate man. He trained his sights on four foreign banks, one after the other — Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), the Mizuho Corporate Bank and the Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft (HVB).\\n\\nSubmitting forged documents, he was able to open accounts in APB’s name, with himself as the sole signatory. With SEB he had a credit facility for $500,000 — which he intended to use for himself.\\n\\nMeanwhile, APB had no idea of what its finance manager was doing behind its back. Chia remained in sole control of all these accounts by forging director board resolutions that authorised him to receive the credit and loan facilities provided, sign all transactions and operate the bank accounts on behalf of APB.\\n\\nTo forge the signatures of the various directors of APB, he obtained specimens from annual reports and internal documents. He practised the signatures till he was sure they would pass muster.\\n\\nChia’s modus operandi was to draw money from SMBC, Mizuho and HVB, and transfer it to the SEB account. From there, the money was siphoned into his two personal accounts with DBS before it was remitted to casinos in Australia, Britain, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines.\\n\\nHe rolled over funds provided by the banks, making timely deposits to each account whenever repayments were due, thus creating the impression of a credit-worthy customer.\\n\\nDuring a crunch situation in November 1999, he even withdrew $53 million from an APB account with OCBC. He managed to replace the entire amount by October 2002, escaping detection. As the amount of illegal money available increased, so did the stakes for which Chia gambled.\\n\\nIn 2002, he met his girlfriend, Chinese national Li Jin, 22, on one of his gambling trips onboard a cruise ship. Li was a croupier in the VVIP (Very Very Important Person) room.\\n\\nHe won $1 million from her and, from then on, she became his “good luck charm”. To make sure his luck continued rolling in, he spared no expense. Chia purchased a $530,000 apartment in Grange Road for her and bought her branded goods and jewellery.\\n\\nHe also bought a $10,000 forged passport so Li could enter Singapore easily. She used it twice — in 2002 and 2003 — and was jailed six months for the offence.\\n\\nBut as the adage goes, the casino always wins and the Commercial Affairs Department got wind of Chia’s activities. He was arrested on Sept 2, 2003. Before his four-year run ended, he had withdrawn $117.1 million. Of this, only $34.8 million was recovered. The authorities estimated that he lost $62 million feeding his gambling habit.\\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Chia wrote a 13-page paper as a form of penance. Called “Taming the Casino Dragon”, he shared his experience as an insider to the world of high rollers.\\n\\nSelf-deprecating at times, and hoping others would not make the same mistakes he did, he wrote that “like an inexperienced teenager succumbing to the lure of a newly discovered vice, I was soon hooked”.\\n\\nCHIA’S DOUBLE LIFE\\n\\nAccountancy graduate Chia Teck Leng began his career at accounting firm Arthur Andersen before taking on a host of high-flying positions, including assistant vice-president at UOB, before becoming finance manager at Asia Pacific Breweries on Jan 20, 1999, with an annual salary of between $200,000 and $300,000.\\n\\nTo colleagues, his wife and two teenage children, he was a hard-working executive and an unassuming family man. But behind that veneer, was a high-rolling casino gambler with a mistress and a “hedonistic” lifestyle.\\n\\nHe had been gambling since 1994. Since July 2000, he had been flying in private chartered jets to Melbourne where he would gamble at the Crown Casino. He was given VIP treatment, staying in its most expensive room, complete with butler service. A night there cost A$25,000.\\n\\nHe was also a regular at London Ritz’s Club, where he could gamble even higher stakes.\\n\\nFrom $200 bets during his Star Cruise days, he went up to single bets of A$20,000 and 25,000 in British ones. He even played for A$400,000 a hand at the Crown Casino.\\n\\nHe met his mistress, Chinese national Li Jin, in April 2002 at the casino on board a cruise ship. She was then a croupier.\\n\\nHe won $1 million from her that night. From then on, he would ask to gamble against her - his “good luck” charm.\\n\\nSuch were the losses suffered that she was eventually given a day off whenever he came on board. The Nanjing University graduate later left her job to be with Chia in Singapore.\\n\\nHe got her a forged passport for $10,000, under the name Chu Chiao-Ling, to enter and leave the country.\\n\\nHe spent lavishly. He bought a $150,000 Mercedes-Benz, a $530,000 apartment in Grange Road, and gave gifts totalling $300,000 to various people, including his girlfriend.\\n\\n\\n\\nChia owned two apartments at Grange Tower and St Francis Lodge.

This was followed by HVB and SEB’s cases also being dismissed.\\n\\nJustice Belinda Ang, in her judgment against HVB and SEB, said that the banks had made themselves “easy prey” by ignoring their own banking procedures and failing to notice discrepancies or irregularities in documents that were “staring bank officers in the face”.\\n\\nThe banks were so eager to do business with APB that they willingly gave out loans of millions of dollars without doing due diligence to verify that Chia was authorised to act for the company, she said.\\n\\nRead other stories from Guilty As Charged: 25 Crimes That Have Shaken Singapore Since 1965 here.\\n\\nMore Singapore crime stories here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'SINGAPORE (March 3): Chia Teck Leng, a former accountant at Asia Pacific Breweries, made history 13 years ago when he was convicted of cheating four banks of S$117 million and sentenced to 42 years’ jail.\\n\\nNow, Chia could be upstaged by John Soh Chee Wen – the alleged mastermind behind the October 2013 penny stock saga.\\n\\nPublic prosecutors in court submissions on Feb 28 had invoked Chia’s name to drive home the seriousness of Soh’s alleged crimes.\\n\\n“[Soh] potentially faces the longest custodial term ever imposed for financial crime in Singapore,” the prosecution team, led by deputy senior state counsel Teo Guan Siew, stated in its submission.\\n\\nThe prosecutors were objecting to John Soh Chee Wen’s application to be allowed bail based on the consequences he could face and, hence, his likely motivation to abscond. Soh is a “real and immediate” flight risk, the prosecutors said.\\n\\nSoh was among some 70 people that the Commercial Affairs Department and Monetary Authority of Singapore began investigating in April 2014 for their roles in the rigging of shares in Blumont Group, LionGold Corp and Asiasons Capital (now Attilan Group).\\n\\nThe three stocks suddenly collapsed in October 2013, vapourising more than S$8 billion in combined market value.\\n\\nSoh is now facing a total of 188 charges, including six of “aggravated cheating”.\\n\\nSpecifically, Soh is alleged to have swindled Goldman Sachs International and Interactive Brokers LLC of more than S$170 million — significantly more than Chia’s haul of S$117 million.\\n\\nSoh apparently used the money to fund a network of proxies to manipulate shares in Blumont, LionGold and Asiasons.\\n\\nAuthorities had earlier described this saga as “the largest market manipulation case in Singapore’s history”.\\n\\nSneak a peek into what is to come at his trial in our cover story “No bail, more charges” in The Edge Singapore (week of March 6), available at newsstand now.',\n",

       "  'text': 'SINGAPORE - Certified public accountant Ewe Pang Kooi was a pathological gambler who usually placed bets of $150,000 each at the table because this gave him a kick.\\n\\nHis lifelong exposure to gambling started at the tender age of six, when he helped with his father\\'s illegal gambling operation in Malaysia.\\n\\nTo feed his gambling addiction, the Perak-born Ewe turned to a life of crime, pocketing $40 million from various clients over a decade.\\n\\nOn Tuesday (May 28), prosecutors sought 30 years\\' jail for the 65-year-old Singapore permanent resident, given the \"phenomenal\" sum taken and his high degree of culpability.\\n\\nThe defence argued for a term of between 12 and 18 years, pointing to how he had fully co-operated with the police.\\n\\nJustice Chan Seng Onn adjourned the case to consider the sentencing arguments. The judge is expected to give his decision in July.\\n\\nEwe is currently out on bail of $1 million.\\n\\nHe was the managing partner of accounting firm Ewe, Loke & Partners, and was also a director of E&M Management Consultants, which provided financial consulting and corporate restructuring services.\\n\\nHe siphoned money from 21 companies he was supposed to liquidate, including six subsidiaries of Hewlett-Packard (HP), and one company whose bank accounts he was managing. He also embezzled the assets of an individual in his role as a receiver.\\n\\nIn his professional roles, Ewe had control over the bank accounts and assets of the clients so that he could make payments to creditors or recover any assets. Instead, he transferred the assets into bank accounts that had him as an authorised signatory.\\n\\nBetween February 2002 and July 2012, he used the misappropriated funds to feed his gambling habit, settle debts or reinstate amounts he had siphoned off.\\n\\nTo cover his tracks, Ewe moved funds between the various entities. But his wrongdoings were uncovered in July 2012 after the HP group chased him about the assets from the liquidation of the companies.\\n\\nIn March, he was convicted of 50 charges of criminal breach of trust as an agent.\\n\\nThe story of how Ewe\\'s \"association with gambling had dogged him all his life\" - in the words of his lawyer Senior Counsel Michael Khoo - emerged during sentencing arguments on Tuesday.\\n\\nGrowing up in a gambling environment, Ewe was helping his father collect betting slips when he was as young as six, said Mr Khoo.\\n\\nHe worked as a croupier at Genting Highlands Resort after completing secondary school in Penang and also in Newcastle, England, while he was studying accountancy.\\n\\nIn the early days of his accountancy career in Singapore, Ewe started gambling on cruise ships and later at the two resort casinos.\\n\\nAs his losses mounted, Ewe first sold his apartment. Then he helped himself to clients\\' money.\\n\\nA psychiatric report submitted by the defence stated that his gambling addiction \"took a life of its own and clouded his judgment\".\\n\\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi said Ewe had a permanent hotel room on Sentosa and usually wagered $150,000 because he did not feel the kick with smaller bets of $1,000. While Ewe did not amass riches from his crimes, he led a high life that he could not have afforded otherwise.\\n\\nThe DPP argued that a deterrent jail term of 30 years was in line with precedents.\\n\\nThey include the cases of former Singapore Airlines supervisor Teo Cheng Kiat, who was jailed 24 years for siphoning $35 million from his employer; former Asia Pacific Breweries executive Chia Teck Leng, jailed 42 years for swindling four banks of $117 million; and former Singapore Land Authority officer Koh Seah Wee, jailed 22 years for a $12 million scam.\\n\\nThe DPP noted that the \"staggering\" outstanding losses of more than $23 million after restitution in Ewe\\'s case dwarfed those in the other cases, except for Chia\\'s.\\n\\nMr Khoo urged the court to consider the case of Setho Oi Lin, who was jailed 12 years for duping 1,341 people into paying about $37.5 million for fake memberships, and that of accounts clerk Richard Tiang, jailed 18 years for embezzling $46 million from his employers.\\n\\nThis article was first published in The Straits Times.
