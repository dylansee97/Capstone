       "  'text': 'Ready to revisit 10 years’ worth of murder, mayhem, witchcraft, satanic possession and aliens? (Actually, let’s scratch that last one.)\\n\\nCreated by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, American Horror Story has conjured up heaps of nightmare fuel over the last nine seasons, and with a new season heading our way (Double Feature premieres Wednesday, Aug. 25 at 10/9c), it’s time to take stock of our most favorite heroes, villains and (literal) monsters in this absolutely bonkers anthology series.\\n\\nBut ranking our faves was no small feat. We limited our list to 25 picks spanning the entire franchise (well, almost the entire franchise — sorry, 1984) to break down the best of the best as we giddily anticipate Season 10. From the inhabitants of Season 1’s haunted dwelling to Apocalypse‘s crossover extravaganza and everything in between, we’ve done our best to rank the series’ most notable characters, which of course includes some of TV’s most twisted individuals.\\n\\nSo which of Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe and Jessica Lange’s characters made the cut, and where did they place? (Spoiler alert: All of Lange’s can be found here.) View the photos below as we count down the greatest AHS characters ever, then hit the Comments section to tell us who we may have forgotten!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Gornick’s interviewees describe how communism saved them from despair, the rut of ill-paid, precarious work in bad conditions, the absence of hope for the future. It also introduced some of them to the joys of intellectual life, a transformative gift in itself. “God, I have never felt so free in my life as I did in those first days when I discovered Marx and the existence of my own mind at the same time,” says a Polish slaughterhouse worker who spent his workdays knee-deep in animal blood and shit. There could be a sense of victory and power, too: Several interviewees describe their participation in successful strikes and labor organizing—one of the most important achievements of the American Communist Party—as the highlight of their lives.\\n\\nRomance is heavily seasoned with psychoanalysis. As one might expect from a person who wrote an entire book, Fierce Attachments, about her enduringly close relationship with a difficult, love-obsessed, widowed mother, Gornick is especially interested in the role of parent-child relations in the conversion to communism. Sometimes it’s a desire to vindicate a working-class father’s suffering, to feel that his pain had meaning: The drudgery of everyday organizing becomes bearable because it is dedicated to his memory. Some subjects are drawn to communism because it compensates for inadequate parents. In other cases, Communist commitment stems from a Freudian excess of filial devotion, as in the case of Belle Rothman:\\n\\nBelle was the daughter of Max Rothman: cigar-maker and Communist. (Oh, these Communist women and their fathers!) Max looked like Trotsky, only better. Max thought like Lenin, only not quite so good. The passion of Max’s life was Communism. The passion of Belle’s life was Max.\\n\\nHere we encounter one of the weaknesses of Romance: Gornick’s insistence that she understands her subjects better than they do, that she can expose their false consciousness. “She hardly knows,” Gornick writes pityingly of Belle, “that the ‘we’ of her speech is not her husband and herself but her father and herself. Max and the Communist Party: that piercing, glowing rapture from which she would never recover and whose sources she would never uncover. Like Teresa penetrated by her angel’s arrow, Belle penetrated by Papa’s revolution.” Belle is cheated of the opportunity to be judged on her own words; a more skillful oral historian could have made insight about Belle’s daddy issues available without indulging in such clumsy editorializing. Here and elsewhere in Romance, Gornick’s intrusive narrative approach reminded me of a heavy-handed psychoanalyst who brings everything, relentlessly, back to the Freudian menu, denying the possibility—the freedom—of speaking about big ideas without relating them to the specifics of childhood. Sometimes a cigar-maker is just a cigar-maker.\\n\\nRomance shows that psychoanalysis and political history don’t always mix well. The psychoanalytic focus on drives tends to empty the content from political commitment. Gornick suggests that Marxism was to Communists what Helen was to Paris, awakening an all-consuming passion, setting in motion “the most intense longings, longings buried in the unknowing self, longings that pierced to the mysterious, vulnerable heart at the center of that incoherent life within us, longings that had to do with the need to live a life of meaning.” Personal relationships certainly do play a substantial role in political commitment, and the search for meaning is a crucial part of the story, but it’s unfair to reduce political convictions to inchoate longings. Misguided though the Communist Party of the USA may have been, communism was a complex ideology with roots in substantive criticisms of capitalism. Besides, Paris’s longing was not mysterious: He wanted the most beautiful woman in the world.',\n",
