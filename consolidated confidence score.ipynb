       "  'description': 'Vivian Gornick specializes in personal narrative. ... Lange explains why she was drawn to Marxism and the party: “The act of understanding...',\n",
       "  'link': 'https://newrepublic.com/article/157527/vivian-gornick-romance-american-communism-reinvigorated-political-writing',\n",
       "  'text': 'Gornick’s interviewees describe how communism saved them from despair, the rut of ill-paid, precarious work in bad conditions, the absence of hope for the future. It also introduced some of them to the joys of intellectual life, a transformative gift in itself. “God, I have never felt so free in my life as I did in those first days when I discovered Marx and the existence of my own mind at the same time,” says a Polish slaughterhouse worker who spent his workdays knee-deep in animal blood and shit. There could be a sense of victory and power, too: Several interviewees describe their participation in successful strikes and labor organizing—one of the most important achievements of the American Communist Party—as the highlight of their lives.\\n\\nRomance is heavily seasoned with psychoanalysis. As one might expect from a person who wrote an entire book, Fierce Attachments, about her enduringly close relationship with a difficult, love-obsessed, widowed mother, Gornick is especially interested in the role of parent-child relations in the conversion to communism. Sometimes it’s a desire to vindicate a working-class father’s suffering, to feel that his pain had meaning: The drudgery of everyday organizing becomes bearable because it is dedicated to his memory. Some subjects are drawn to communism because it compensates for inadequate parents. In other cases, Communist commitment stems from a Freudian excess of filial devotion, as in the case of Belle Rothman:\\n\\nBelle was the daughter of Max Rothman: cigar-maker and Communist. (Oh, these Communist women and their fathers!) Max looked like Trotsky, only better. Max thought like Lenin, only not quite so good. The passion of Max’s life was Communism. The passion of Belle’s life was Max.\\n\\nHere we encounter one of the weaknesses of Romance: Gornick’s insistence that she understands her subjects better than they do, that she can expose their false consciousness. “She hardly knows,” Gornick writes pityingly of Belle, “that the ‘we’ of her speech is not her husband and herself but her father and herself. Max and the Communist Party: that piercing, glowing rapture from which she would never recover and whose sources she would never uncover. Like Teresa penetrated by her angel’s arrow, Belle penetrated by Papa’s revolution.” Belle is cheated of the opportunity to be judged on her own words; a more skillful oral historian could have made insight about Belle’s daddy issues available without indulging in such clumsy editorializing. Here and elsewhere in Romance, Gornick’s intrusive narrative approach reminded me of a heavy-handed psychoanalyst who brings everything, relentlessly, back to the Freudian menu, denying the possibility—the freedom—of speaking about big ideas without relating them to the specifics of childhood. Sometimes a cigar-maker is just a cigar-maker.\\n\\nRomance shows that psychoanalysis and political history don’t always mix well.

       "  'text': 'Gornick’s interviewees describe how communism saved them from despair, the rut of ill-paid, precarious work in bad conditions, the absence of hope for the future. It also introduced some of them to the joys of intellectual life, a transformative gift in itself. “God, I have never felt so free in my life as I did in those first days when I discovered Marx and the existence of my own mind at the same time,” says a Polish slaughterhouse worker who spent his workdays knee-deep in animal blood and shit. There could be a sense of victory and power, too: Several interviewees describe their participation in successful strikes and labor organizing—one of the most important achievements of the American Communist Party—as the highlight of their lives.\\n\\nRomance is heavily seasoned with psychoanalysis. As one might expect from a person who wrote an entire book, Fierce Attachments, about her enduringly close relationship with a difficult, love-obsessed, widowed mother, Gornick is especially interested in the role of parent-child relations in the conversion to communism. Sometimes it’s a desire to vindicate a working-class father’s suffering, to feel that his pain had meaning: The drudgery of everyday organizing becomes bearable because it is dedicated to his memory. Some subjects are drawn to communism because it compensates for inadequate parents. In other cases, Communist commitment stems from a Freudian excess of filial devotion, as in the case of Belle Rothman:\\n\\nBelle was the daughter of Max Rothman: cigar-maker and Communist. (Oh, these Communist women and their fathers!) Max looked like Trotsky, only better. Max thought like Lenin, only not quite so good. The passion of Max’s life was Communism. The passion of Belle’s life was Max.\\n\\nHere we encounter one of the weaknesses of Romance: Gornick’s insistence that she understands her subjects better than they do, that she can expose their false consciousness. “She hardly knows,” Gornick writes pityingly of Belle, “that the ‘we’ of her speech is not her husband and herself but her father and herself. Max and the Communist Party: that piercing, glowing rapture from which she would never recover and whose sources she would never uncover. Like Teresa penetrated by her angel’s arrow, Belle penetrated by Papa’s revolution.” Belle is cheated of the opportunity to be judged on her own words; a more skillful oral historian could have made insight about Belle’s daddy issues available without indulging in such clumsy editorializing.

Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte, in his former capacity as the National Police\\'s international relations division head, is alleged to have accepted approximately Rp 6.1 billion in total for his role in removing Djoko\\'s Interpol red notice status thereby allowing the latter to freely enter Indonesia despite being wanted by the police since 2009.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Brig. Gen Prasetyo Utomo, the former head of the Civil Servant Investigators Supervisory and Coordination Bureau at the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim), is accused of having accepted $150,000 in bribes.\\n\\nBoth Napoleon and Prasetyo received the money from businessman Tommy Sumardi, who allegedly acted as middleman, prosecutor Zulkipli told the court on Monday.\\n\\n\"Defendant H. Tommy Sumardi together with Djoko Soegiarto Tjandra gave to [Napoleon] Sing$200,000 [$146,341] and $270,000 [...] and $150,000 to [Prasetyo],\" Zulkipli said as quoted by kompas.com.\\n\\nRead also: Commission to follow up ICW reports on irregularities in Pinangki’s case\\n\\nAccording to the indictment, Napoleon received the Singaporean dollars on April 28, $100,000 on April 29, $150,000 on May 4, and $20,000 on May 5. He reportedly demanded a larger sum of money from Djoko after learning that Prasetyo had also asked for a share.\\n\\nThe case implicating the two generals was uncovered after Djoko sought to enter Indonesia in June as he planned to file a case review at the South Jakarta District Court against his conviction in the 1998 Bank Bali corruption scandal.\\n\\nDjoko fled the country a day before the Supreme Court sentenced him to two years in prison and ordered him to pay Rp 546 billion for his crime in 2009.\\n\\nInterpol issued a red notice against Djoko in the same year, requesting that law enforcement authorities worldwide locate and arrest him. Djoko was then put on Interpol’s most-wanted list in 2015.\\n\\nThrough Tommy, who is also a defendant in the bribery case, Djoko offered Rp 10 billion to whomever could grant him access to enter Indonesia.\\n\\nRead also: Djoko Tjandra admits to bribing two police generals\\n\\nTommy later sought help from Napoleon, who then agreed to remove Djoko\\'s red notice status, and asked Prasetyo to issue a letter that allowed Djoko to travel within the country, the indictment said.\\n\\nWith the official police travel letter issued on June 18, Djoko was able to fly from Jakarta to Pontianak in West Kalimantan on June 19 and returned on June 22 in his capacity as a consultant.\\n\\nDjoko remained at large for 11 years before the police finally arrested him in Malaysia on July 30.\\n\\nIn addition to issuing the travel letter, Prasetyo was also indicted for document forgery as he allegedly ordered his subordinates to falsify several details in the document and burn the letter afterward to eliminate any evidence linking him to the fugitive.\\n\\nThe two police generals have been charged under several articles in the 2001 Corruption Law and Article 55 of the Criminal Code on complicity in a crime.
