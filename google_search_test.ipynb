      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON – Today the U.S. Department of the Treasury took another step in our ongoing efforts to disrupt North Korean financial networks supporting the regime’s illicit ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs and proliferation activities. Daedong Credit Bank (DCB), together with DCB Finance Limited—a DCB front company—and DCB’s representative Kim Chol Sam were designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of WMD and their supporters. The financial operations carried out by DCB, DCB Finance Limited, and Kim Chol Sam are responsible for managing millions of dollars of transactions in support of the North Korean regime’s destabilizing activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treasury Department also designated Son Mun San, the External Affairs Bureau Chief of North Korea’s General Bureau of Atomic Energy (GBAE) under E.O. 13882 for his work directing North Korea’s nuclear-related research efforts. The GBAE, which was previously designated by the U.S. and the UN, is responsible for North Korea’s nuclear program, which includes the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center and its five megawatt plutonium production research reactor, as well as its fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although the recent spate of provocations has waned, North Korea’s dangerous and destabilizing illicit nuclear and ballistic missile program continues apace, supported by North Korean financial institutions like Daedong Credit Bank. We are committed to increasing the sanctions pressure on North Korea until it complies with its international obligations,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “We urge financial institutions around the world to be wary of dealing with Daedong Credit Bank and the other designated entities in order to maintain the transparency and legitimacy of the international financial system.”\n",
      "\n",
      "North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and proliferation activities violate UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), and 2094 (2013); destabilize the region; and undermine the global nonproliferation regime. Today’s designations build upon other recent U.S. efforts to target DPRK proliferation activities, including the March 2013 designation of North Korea’s main foreign exchange bank, the Foreign Trade Bank (FTB).\n",
      "\n",
      "Daedong Credit Bank has engaged in the same type of activity that was at issue in the FTB designation, most notably providing financial services to the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID), Pyongyang's premier arms dealer as well as KOMID’s main financial arm, the Tanchon Commercial Bank (TCB), both of which have been previously designated by the U.S. for the central role they play supporting North Korea’s illicit nuclear and ballistic missiles programs. KOMID and TCB were also designated by the United Nations. UNSCR 2094 requires the imposition of targeted financial sanctions on entities that work for or on behalf of, or at the direction of, UN-designated North Korean entities. Since at least 2007, Daedong Credit Bank (DCB) has facilitated hundreds of financial transactions worth millions of dollars on behalf of KOMID and TCB. In some cases, DCB has knowingly facilitated transactions by using deceptive financial practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "DCB Finance Limited and Kim Chol Sam\n",

      "Since at least 2006, Daedong Credit Bank has used its front company, DCB Finance Limited, to carry out international financial transactions as a means to avoid scrutiny by financial institutions avoiding business with North Korea. DCB Finance Limited is registered in the British Virgin Islands and also operates out of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Chol Sam is a representative for Daedong Credit Bank who has also been involved in managing transactions on behalf of DCB Finance Limited. As a Dalian, China-based representative of DCB, it is suspected Kim Chol Sam has facilitated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and likely managed millions of dollars in North-Korean related accounts.\n",

      "\n",
      "For other people named Kim Jong-un, see Kim Jong-un (disambiguation)\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Jong-un[a][b] ( ;[6] Korean: 김정은; Korean: [kim.dzɔŋ.ɯn];[c] born 8 January 1982 or 1983) is a North Korean politician who has been Supreme Leader of North Korea since 2011 and the leader of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) since 2012.[d] He is the second child of Kim Jong-il, who was North Korea's second supreme leader from 1994 to 2011, and Ko Yong-hui. He is the grandson of Kim Il-sung, who was the founder and first supreme leader of North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as successor to the leadership of North Korea. Following his father's death in December 2011, state television announced Kim Jong-un as the \"Great Successor\". Kim holds the titles of General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea,[7] Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and President of the State Affairs Commission. He is also a member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, the highest decision-making body. In July 2012, Kim was promoted to the highest rank of Marshal in the Korean People's Army, consolidating his position as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. North Korean state media often refer to him as \"the Marshal\" or \"Dear Respected Leader\". He has promoted the policy of byungjin, similar to Kim Il-sung's policy from the 1960s, referring to the simultaneous development of both the economy and the country's nuclear weapons program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim's leadership has followed the same cult of personality as his grandfather and father. In 2014, a UNHRC report suggested that Kim could be put on trial for crimes against humanity. He has ordered the purge or execution of several North Korean officials; he is also widely believed to have ordered the 2017 assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia. He has presided over an expansion of the consumer economy, construction projects and tourist attractions. Kim also expanded North Korea's nuclear program which led to heightened tensions with the United States and South Korea. In 2018 and 2019, Kim took part in summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump. He has claimed success in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in North Korea, although many experts doubt the country has had no cases altogether.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "North Korean authorities and state-run media have stated Kim's birthdate was 8 January 1982,[1] but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later.[2] It is thought that Kim's official birth year was changed for symbolic reasons; 1982 marks 70 years after the birth of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, and 40 years after the official birth of his father Kim Jong-il.[9] Before 2018 the US Treasury Department listed Kim Jong-un's official birthdate as 8 January 1984. Now, the birthdate is listed as 8 January 1983, aligning with South Korea's birthdate for Kim Jong-un.[9] The claim that he was born in 1984 matches that given by his aunt and uncle, who moved to the United States in 1998 and were interrogated by the CIA.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Jong-un is the second of three children Ko Yong-hui bore to Kim Jong-il; his elder brother Kim Jong-chul was born in 1981, while his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is believed to have been born in 1987.[11][12][13] He is a grandson of Kim Il-sung, who was the founder of and led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "All the children of Kim Jong-il are said to have lived in Switzerland, as well as the mother of the two youngest sons, who lived in Geneva for some time.[15] First reports said that Kim Jong-un attended the private International School of Berne in Gümligen in Switzerland under the name \"Chol-pak\" or \"Pak-chol\" from 1993 to 1998.[16] He was described as shy, a good student who got along well with his classmates, and was a basketball fan.[17] He was chaperoned by an older student, who was thought to be his bodyguard.[18] However, it was later suggested that the student at the Gümligen school was not Kim Jong-un, but his elder brother Kim Jong-chul.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in Köniz Switzerland , reportedly attended by Kim Jong-un\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, it was reported that Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinhölzli state school in Köniz near Bern under the name \"Pak-un\" or \"Un-pak\" from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the North Korean embassy in Bern. Authorities confirmed that a North Korean student from North Korea attended the school during that period. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000. He was described as a well-integrated and ambitious student who liked to play basketball.[20] However, his grades and attendance rating are reported to have been poor.[21] The ambassador of North Korea in Switzerland, Ri Chol, had a close relationship with him and acted as a mentor.[15] One of Pak-un's classmates told reporters that he had told him that he was the son of the leader of North Korea.[22][23] According to some reports, Kim was described by classmates as a shy child who was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues, but who distinguished himself in sports and had a fascination with the American National Basketball Association and Michael Jordan. One friend claimed that he had been shown pictures of Pak-un with Kobe Bryant and Toni Kukoč.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the University of Lyon, France, compared the picture of Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 and concluded that the faces show a conformity of 95%, suggesting that it is most likely that they are the same person.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Post reported in 2009 that Kim Jong-un's school friends recalled he \"spent hours doing meticulous pencil drawings of Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan\".[27] He was obsessed with basketball and computer games,[24][28] and was a fan of Jackie Chan action movies.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Most analysts agree that Kim Jong-un attended Kim Il-sung University, a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang, from 2002 to 2007.[30] Kim obtained two degrees, one in physics at Kim Il-sung University and another as an Army officer at the Kim Il-sung Military University.[31][32]\n",
      "\n",
      "In late February 2018, Reuters reported that Kim and his father had used forged passports—supposedly issued by Brazil and dated 26 February 1996—to apply for visas in various countries. Both 10-year passports carry a stamp saying \"Embassy of Brazil in Prague\". Kim Jong-un's passport records the name \"Josef Pwag\" and a date of birth of 1 February 1983.[33]\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, only one confirmed photograph of him was known to exist outside North Korea, apparently taken in the mid-1990s, when he was eleven.[34] Occasionally, other supposed images of him surfaced but were often disputed.[35] It was only in June 2010, shortly before he was given official posts and publicly introduced to the North Korean people, that more pictures were released of Kim, taken when he was attending school in Switzerland.[36] The first official image of him as an adult was a group photograph released on 30 September 2010, at the end of the party conference that effectively anointed him, in which he is seated in the front row, two places from his father. This was followed by newsreel footage of him attending the conference.[37]\n",

Fujimoto also said that Jong-un was favored by his father over his elder brother, Kim Jong-chul, reasoning that Jong-chul is too feminine in character, while Jong-un is \"exactly like his father\".[41] Furthermore, Fujimoto stated that \"if power is to be handed over then Jong-un is the best for it. He has superb physical gifts, is a big drinker and never admits defeat.\" Also, according to Fujimoto, Jong-un smokes Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes, loves Johnnie Walker whisky and has a Mercedes-Benz 600 luxury sedan.[42] When Jong-un was 18, Fujimoto described an episode where Jong-un once questioned his lavish lifestyle and asked, \"we are here, playing basketball, riding horses, riding jet skis, having fun together. But what of the lives of the average people?\"[41] On 15 January 2009, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that Kim Jong-il had appointed Kim Jong-un to be his successor.[38][43]\n",

      "From 2009, it was understood by foreign diplomatic services that Kim was to succeed his father Kim Jong-il as the head of the Korean Workers' Party and de facto leader of North Korea.[47] He has been named \"Yŏngmyŏng-han Tongji\" (영명한 동지), which loosely translates to \"Brilliant Comrade\".[48] His father had also asked embassy staff abroad to pledge loyalty to his son.[49] There have also been reports that citizens in North Korea were encouraged to sing a newly composed \"song of praise\" to Kim Jong-un, in a similar fashion to that of praise songs relating to Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung.[50] Later, in June, Kim was reported to have visited China secretly to \"present himself\" to the Chinese leadership, who later warned against North Korea conducting another nuclear test.[51] The Chinese foreign ministry has strongly denied that this visit occurred.[52]\n",

This was seen as confirming his position as the next leader of the Workers' Party. Unprecedented international press access was granted to the event, further indicating the importance of Kim Jong-un's presence.[61] In January 2011, the regime reportedly began purging around 200 protégés of both Jong-un's uncle-in-law Jang Song-thaek and O Kuk-ryol, the vice chairman of the National Defence Commission, by either detention or execution to further prevent either man from rivaling Jong-un.[62]\n",

The Korean Central News Agency described Kim Jong-un as \"a great person born of heaven\", a propaganda term only his father and grandfather had enjoyed.[69] And the ruling Workers' Party said in an editorial, \"We vow with bleeding tears to call Kim Jong-un our supreme commander, our leader.\"[70]\n",

The conference then elected Kim Jong-un as leader of the party under the newly created title of First Secretary. Kim Jong-un also took his father's post as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, as well as his father's old seat on the Politburo Presidium.[76] In a speech made prior to the Conference, Kim Jong-un declared that \"Imbuing the whole society with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the highest programme of our Party\".[77] On 13 April 2012, the 5th Session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly appointed Kim Jong-un First Chairman of the National Defence Commission.[78]\n",

Kim Jong-un commands the armed forces, Kim Tok-hun heads the government and handles domestic affairs, and Choe Ryong-hae handles foreign relations. However, under the constitution, Kim Jong-un is the highest-ranking of the three. Since 1998, the NDC chairmanship has been constitutionally defined as \"the highest post in the state\",[90] and a constitutional amendment enacted by Kim Jong-un explicitly named the NDC (first) chairman as \"the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea\".[91] However, analysts are divided about how much actual power Kim has.[92][93][94]\n",

North Korea has changed a lot since Kim Jong-un assumed power. All of this is because of leader Kim Jong-un.\"[101]\n",
      "\n",
      "According to analysts, Kim Jong-un has used his resemblance to his grandfather to harness Kim Il-sung's personality cult and popular nostalgia for earlier times.[102] In 2013, Kim copied his grandfather's style when he gave his first New Year's address, a break from the approach of his father, Kim Jong-il, who never made a televised address during his 17 years in power.[103] He has also appeared more accessible and open than his father, hugging and linking arms with young and old.[102] In his public appearances, he appears more active than his father or grandfather, for example, weeding, riding a horse, driving a tank, riding a rollercoaster, or using information technology.[102]\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2012, when a satellite launch failed, the government admitted this publicly, the first time it had ever done so.[102] In May 2014, following the collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un was said to be very upset at the loss of life that resulted. A statement issued by the country's official news agency the Korean Central News Agency used the rare expression \"profound consolation and apology\". An unnamed government official was quoted by the BBC as saying Kim Jong-un had \"sat up all night, feeling painful\".[104] While the height of the building and the number of casualties was not released, media reports described it is a 23-story building and indicated that more than a hundred people may have died in the collapse.[105]\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic policies\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Jong-un has been promoting a policy of byungjin, similar to his grandfather Kim il-sung's policies from the 1960s, developing the national economy in parallel with the nations nuclear weapons program.[106][107][108] A set of comprehensive economic measures, the \"Socialist Corporate Responsible Management System\", were introduced in 2013.[109] The measures increase the autonomy of enterprises by granting them \"certain rights to engage in business activities autonomously and elevate the will to labor through appropriately implementing the socialist distribution system\". Another priority of economic policies that year was agriculture, where the pojon (vegetable garden) responsibility system was implemented. The system reportedly achieved a major increase in output in some collective farms.[109] North Korean media were describing the economy as a \"flexible collectivist system\" where enterprises were applying \"active and evolutionary actions\" to achieve economic development.[110] These reports reflect Kim's general economic policy of reforming management, increasing the autonomy and incentives for economic actors. This set of reforms known as the \"May 30th measures\" reaffirms both socialist ownership and \"objective economic laws in guidance and management\" to improve living standards. Other objectives of the measures are to increase the availability of domestically manufactured goods on markets, introduction of defence innovations into the civilian sector and boost international trade.[110]\n",

      "There has been a construction boom in Pyongyang, bringing colour and creative architectural styles to the city. While in the past there was a concentration on building monuments, Kim Jong-un's government has constructed amusement parks, aquatic parks, skating rinks, a dolphinarium and a ski resort.[111][112] Kim has been actively promoting a consumer culture, including entertainment and cosmetics.[102]\n",

Yonhap has stated that, according to multiple unnamed sources, Kim Jong-un has also put to death members of Jang's family, to completely destroy all traces of Jang's existence through \"extensive executions\" of his family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives. Those reportedly killed in Kim's purge include Jang's sister Jang Kye-sun, her husband and ambassador to Cuba, Jon Yong-jin, and Jang's nephew and ambassador to Malaysia, Jang Yong-chol. The nephew's two sons were also said to have been killed.[117] At the time of Jang's removal, it was announced that \"the discovery and purge of the Jang group ... made our party and revolutionary ranks purer ...\"[118] and after his execution on 12 December 2013 state media warned that the army \"will never pardon all those who disobey the order of the Supreme Commander\".[119]\n",

      "In 2018, Kim received delivery of two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600s, each valued at $500,000, through an illicit shipping network in violation of international sanctions.[190]\n",

      "Health\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2009, reports suggested that Kim Jong-un was a diabetic and suffered from hypertension.[49][191] He is also known to smoke cigarettes.[192]\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Jong-un did not appear in public for six weeks in September and October 2014. State media reported that he was suffering from an \"uncomfortable physical condition\". Previously he had been limping.[193] When he reappeared, he was using a walking stick.[194]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2015, the South Korean government commented that Kim appeared to have gained 30 kg in body fat over the previous five years, reaching a total estimated body weight of 130 kg (290 lb).[195]\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2020, Kim was not seen in public for 20 days, and there were rumours that he was critically ill or even dead.[196][197][198]\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 2021, following a one-month-long absence from the public eye, outside observers noted that Kim had lost weight.[199]\n",

      "Family\n",
      "\n",
      "On 25 July 2012, North Korean state media reported for the first time that Kim Jong-un is married to Ri Sol-ju.[200][201] Ri, who was believed to be in her early 20s, had been accompanying Kim Jong-un to public appearances for several weeks prior to the announcement.[201] According to a South Korean analyst, Kim Jong-il had hastily arranged the marriage after suffering a stroke in 2008, the two married in 2009, and they had a child in 2010.[202] Dennis Rodman, after visiting in 2013, reported that they had a second newborn child, a daughter named Ju-ae.[203][204] According to South Korean intelligence sources, the couple is believed to have had a third child of unknown sex in February 2017.[205][206]\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim is sometimes accompanied by his younger sister Kim Yo-jong,[11][12] who is said to be instrumental in creating his public image and organising public events for him.[207] According to Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, and others, the promotion of Yo-jong and others is a sign that \"the Kim Jong-un regime has ended its co-existence with the remnants of the previous Kim Jong-il regime by carrying out a generational replacement in the party's key elite posts\".[208]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the exiled half-brother of Kim Jong-un, was assassinated with the nerve agent VX while walking through Terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.[209] Jong-un is widely believed to have ordered the assassination.[210][211]\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Thursday it was sanctioning North Korea’s Daedong Credit Bank for its role in supporting Pyongyang’s weapons of mass destruction program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Treasury said Daedong Credit Bank has been providing financial services to the Korea Mining Developing Trading Corp or KOMID, which it said was Pyongyang’s premier arms dealers, and the Tanchon Commercial Bank or TCB, its main financial arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since at least 2007, Daedong Credit Bank has facilitated hundreds of financial transactions worth millions of dollars on behalf of KOMID and TCB,” the Treasury said. “In some cases, (it) had knowingly facilitated transactions by using deceptive financial practices.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treasury said it was also sanctioning a Daedong front company called DCB Financial Limited, that company’s representative, Kim Chol Sam, and Son Mun San, the external affairs bureau chief of North Korea’s Bureau of Atomic Energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It said the front company had carried out international financial transactions as a way to avoid scrutiny by institutions trying to avoid doing business with North Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action generally prohibits U.S. citizens from engaging in any transactions with the entities or persons targeted, and freezes any assets they might have in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fresh set of sanctions follows a decision by the United States in March to target North Korean’s Foreign Trade Bank, its main foreign exchange institution, to try to choke off cash to the government in Pyongyang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks in the European Union have been reluctant to do business with FTB in the wake of the U.S. sanctions, and China’s biggest foreign exchange bank, the Bank of China, closed FTB’s account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations said in May that increasingly tough financial sanctions, an arms embargo and other international restrictions on trade have significantly delayed expansion of North Korea’s nuclear arms program. The report did not cover the effects of the sanctions imposed in March.\n",
